# dio-challenges-creating-delivery-assistant-using-step-functions
Project made during DIO's "Nexa - Engenharia de Prompts na AWS com Claude" Bootcamp, under the section "Criando um Assistente de Delivery com AWS Step Functions e Bedrock"

This project is a study case where AWS Step Functions was used to create a workflow/state machine which gives suggestions for a delivery. In the state machine, only one AWS service was used: Amazon Bedrock, and the selected model was **Titan Text G1 - Lite**. The entire state machine is uploaded as a JSON file in the repository.
